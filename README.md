# ðŸ§  ANN â€” Churn & Salary Prediction (Streamlit Deployments)
A dual-purpose **deep learning** project demonstrating how **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)** can power both Customer Churn Classification and Salary Regression â€” all integrated into two interactive Streamlit applications.

## ðŸš€ Overview
This repository features two **ANN-based Streamlit apps** for real-time prediction:

ðŸŽ¯ Customer Churn Prediction â†’ Predicts whether a customer will exit a service.

ðŸ’° Salary Prediction â†’ Estimates an employeeâ€™s salary based on given attributes.

Each app loads pre-trained **ANN models** and preprocessing artifacts for seamless inference.
