# ðŸ§  ANN â€” Churn & Salary Prediction (Streamlit Deployments)
A lightweight **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** repository featuring two **Streamlit applications** for real-time prediction â€” a dual-purpose **deep learning** project demonstrating how **ANNs** power both Customer Churn Classification and Salary Regression, seamlessly integrated into interactive apps.

## ðŸš€ Overview
This repository features two **ANN-based Streamlit apps** for real-time prediction:

ðŸŽ¯ churn_app.py â€” Predicts whether a customer will exit a service (Classification).

ðŸ’° salary_app.py â€” Estimates an employeeâ€™s salary based on given features (Regression).

Each app loads pre-trained **ANN models** and preprocessing artifacts for seamless inference.

## âš¡ Highlights
* Two pre-trained **ANN models** (`.h5`) built using **TensorFlow/Keras**
* Interactive Streamlit UI for real-time predictions
* Preprocessing artifacts stored in organized model folders
* Includes notebooks for training, tuning, and inference
* Ready for deployment on Streamlit Cloud
