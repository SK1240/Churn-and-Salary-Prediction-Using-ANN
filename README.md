# 🧠 ANN — Churn & Salary Prediction (Streamlit Deployments)
A lightweight **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** repository featuring two **Streamlit applications** for real-time prediction — a dual-purpose **deep learning** project demonstrating how **ANNs** power both Customer Churn Classification and Salary Regression, seamlessly integrated into interactive apps.

## 🚀 Overview
This repository features two **ANN-based Streamlit apps** for real-time prediction:

🎯 churn_app.py — Predicts whether a customer will exit a service (Classification).

💰 salary_app.py — Estimates an employee’s salary based on given features (Regression).

Each app loads pre-trained **ANN models** and preprocessing artifacts for seamless inference.
